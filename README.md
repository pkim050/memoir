# README

Hello Anika and Uchae. I basically created a Rails app and installed devise to imitate of what I saw from the interview yesterday. I wanted to go back to the issue and try and resolve it.

I obviously did not perform anywhere near to anyone's standards and somehow lost the track of time. I want to go ahead and showcase that I can do what was asked for. Just for simplicity, I went ahead and created posts instead of journal entries and we are going to assume posts are the journal entries.

Issue #1
After creating a post, all other users that are not associated with this specific post can still see them, through index and show page. How do we make it so that they are able to see only their own private posts?
